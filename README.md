# OpenCV & TensorFlow Integration

This repository demonstrates how to combine **OpenCV**, a powerful computer vision library, with **TensorFlow**, a leading deep learning framework, to build advanced AI-powered vision applications. It includes practical examples, tutorials, and code for processing images and videos, training and deploying models, and performing real-time object detection and classification.

## Features

- **Image Processing with OpenCV:**  
  Preprocessing techniques including resizing, filtering, edge detection, and transformations.

- **Deep Learning with TensorFlow:**  
  Training and using neural networks for image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

- **Real-Time Video Analysis:**  
  Capture and analyze video streams from webcams or files using OpenCV, integrated with TensorFlow models.

- **Object Detection Pipelines:**  
  Examples using pre-trained TensorFlow models (e.g., SSD, Faster R-CNN) with OpenCV for detection and tracking.

- **Data Preparation:**  
  Scripts for annotating, augmenting, and preparing datasets for model training.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/opencv-tensorflow-integration.git
    cd opencv-tensorflow-integration
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run example scripts to test functionality. For example, to run object detection:

```bash
python object_detection.py
